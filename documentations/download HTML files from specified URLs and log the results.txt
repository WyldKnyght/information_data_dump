Command evaluate_code returned: 1. Instead of hardcoding the URLs in the script, consider passing them as arguments to the function.
2. Use a context manager to open the file instead of manually closing it in the finally block.
3. Consider using f-strings for string formatting instead of concatenation.
4. Add error handling for the case where the URL does not contain a valid file name.

Command evaluate_code returned: 1. Use a context manager for the `logging` module to avoid having to close the file manually.
2. Consider using a `try-except-finally` block to ensure that the file is closed even if an exception is raised.
3. Add more specific error messages to the logging statements to make it easier to diagnose issues.
4. Consider using a `Path` object from the `pathlib` module to manipulate file paths instead of string manipulation.

Command evaluate_code returned: 1. Add error handling for file writing to prevent data loss in case of write errors.
2. Consider using a more descriptive file naming convention instead of just using the second-to-last part of the URL.
3. Add logging to keep track of which files were successfully downloaded and which ones failed.

Command evaluate_code returned: The code looks good. However, it would be better to handle any exceptions that may occur during the requests and file operations. You can add a try-except block to handle any exceptions and return an informative message to the user.
