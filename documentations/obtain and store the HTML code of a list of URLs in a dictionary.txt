Command evaluate_code returned: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Instead of storing the HTML code as a string in the dictionary, you can store the BeautifulSoup object itself. This will allow you to perform further parsing and analysis on the HTML code without having to re-parse it.

2. It's a good practice to define functions with a single responsibility. In this case, you can define a separate function to handle the HTTP requests and error handling, and another function to parse the HTML code.

3. You can use a context manager to handle the HTTP requests, which will automatically close the connection when the request is complete.

4. Instead of printing the error message and returning None, you can raise a custom exception to handle the error in a more structured way.

Here's an updated version of the code with these suggestions implemented:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Dict

class RequestError(Exception):
    pass

def get_html(url: str) -> BeautifulSoup:
    try:
        with requests.get(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}) as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
            return soup
    except (requests.exceptions.HTTPError, requests.exceptions.RequestException) as error:
        raise RequestError(f'Request failed: {url}. {error.__class__.__name__}: {str(error)}')

def parse_html(html: str) -> Dict:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    # Perform further parsing and analysis on the HTML code here
    return {'title': soup.title.string}

url_list = ['https://pokemontcg.io/','https://dev.pokemontcg.io/','https://pokeapi.co/']

html_dict = {}
for url in url_list:
    try:
        html = get_html(url)
        html_dict[url] = parse_html(html)
    except RequestError as error:
        print(error)

print(html_dict)
```
