The PokÃ©mon TCG API provides a comprehensive dataset of card data from Base Set to Sword & Shield. The API includes prices by TCGplayer, hi-res images, detailed search queries, and developer SDKs. It also provides in-depth details of every card, delivered in JSON format such as types, attacks, abilities, and more. Advanced search queries can be performed with a familiar Lucene-like syntax, and the API supports operators such as logical AND, OR, NOT, and range operators. The website also offers a developer portal for managing accounts and API keys and access to higher rate limits and no IP restrictions.
