The PokÃ©mon TCG API offers card data, prices by TCGplayer, hi-res images, detailed search queries, developer SDKs, and in-depth details of every card for developers. It allows developers to ingest card data programmatically and stay up to date with new sets and access new data on launch day. The API also offers advanced search queries with a familiar Lucene-like syntax, allowing developers to filter to specific cards using logical operators. Developers can manage their account and API Key associated with the API via the PokÃ©mon TCG Developer Portal. They can also ask for help at the community Discord channel, or contact Andrew via email for inquiries regarding higher rate limits.
